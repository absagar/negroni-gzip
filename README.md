# gzip

Gzip middleware for Negroni.

Mostly a copy of the Martini gzip module with small changes to make it function
under Negroni. Support for setting the compression level has also been added
and tests have been written. Test coverage is 100% according to 'git cover'.

## Usage

~~~ go
import (
    "github.com/codegangsta/negroni"
    "github.com/phyber/negroni-gzip/gzip"
)

func main() {
    mux := http.NewServeMux()
    mux.HandleFunc("/", func(w http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request) {
      fmt.Fprintf(w, "Welcome to the home page!")
    }
    n := negroni.Classic()
    n.Use(gzip.Gzip(gzip.DefaultCompression))
    n.UseHandler(mux)
    n.Run(":3000")
}

~~~

Make sure to include the Gzip middleware above other middleware that alter the response body.
